"""Generic CRUD repository for LanceDB-backed tables.

``LanceRepoBase`` mirrors the SQLite ``RepoBase`` shape: a pure generic
CRUD helper that knows nothing about a storage runtime. Concrete repos
either pass an :class:`AsyncTable` explicitly (typical in tests) or
override :meth:`_table_lookup` to pull the cached table from their
storage manager (typical in
:mod:`everos.infra.persistence.lancedb.repos`).

Every operation is bounded by a **deadline** (:meth:`_locked` /
:meth:`_deadline`): no read, write, or maintenance call can hang
forever, and no writer can wait on — or hold — a table's write lock
indefinitely. On expiry the caller gets a retryable
:class:`~everos.core.errors.VectorStoreBusyError`.

    materialises them, where they accumulate as inodes and slow every

    1. **``rmdir`` cannot delete data.** The kernel refuses it on a non-empty
       directory (``ENOTEMPTY``). No file can be lost through this function

    expressed here. The two guarantees above are what make the sweep safe;

    2. **Lazy hook (production singletons)** — override
       :meth:`_table_lookup` so the repo can be instantiated as a

    Write paths (``add`` / ``upsert`` / ``delete`` / ``delete_by_md_path``)
    are serialised by a per-``table_name`` :class:`asyncio.Lock`. LanceDB's
    ``merge_insert`` is a read-modify-write at the storage layer with no
    application-visible OCC contract — two concurrent calls against the
    same table can race on the version manifest and lose updates even
    when the row sets are disjoint (observed: cascade worker
    ``asyncio.gather`` over a batch of ``user_profile`` rows where one
    write disappears). Serialising on the table name closes that window;
    reads stay unlocked so search QPS is not impacted by writers.

    Locks live in a class-level dict keyed by table name and are never
    evicted (mirrors :mod:`everos.memory.strategies._partition_locks`

        ``optimize()`` is a **performance + storage-hygiene** operation,

        writes new data into a fresh fragment that the FTS / vector
        indexes don't cover yet; queries stay correct regardless because
        LanceDB transparently brute-force flat-scans that unindexed tail
        and unions it with the indexed hits (verified on lancedb 0.30.2).

        What ``optimize()`` actually buys on the current stack:

        - **Query speed** — the unindexed tail is flat-scanned on every
          query; merging it into the index keeps that scan bounded as
          ingest accumulates.
        - **Storage hygiene** is *not* done here — physical reclamation
          of replaced fragments / stale manifests / dead index files is
          :meth:`prune`, a separate write-locked call.

        Cascade triggers this through a per-kind throttle + trailing
        edge scheduler (``CascadeWorker._schedule_optimize``): at most
        one run per throttle window per kind, decoupled from the drain
        loop, with a heartbeat sweep as a safety net. Cost is O(N)
        data-rewrite per optimized fragment; the throttle is how we cap
        it under sustained write pressure.

        This is **compaction only** and takes **no lock**: a
        ``Retryable commit conflict`` against a concurrent writer is
        benign here (compaction is not urgent — the next scheduled beat
        retries), so it must never stall writers.

        LanceDB's ``AsyncTable`` cannot clean up independently of compaction —
        the only handle is ``optimize(cleanup_older_than=..., delete_unverified=...)``,
        which bundles compact + cleanup into one manifest commit. Under
        sustained churn that commit is a Rewrite that concurrent Delete /
        Update writes preempt, so the bundled cleanup loses the race and
        never runs (observed upstream: 16 successes / 547 conflicts over 21h
        → the index dir grew unbounded to the disk guardrail).

        Fix: run it **under the per-table write lock** so no write is in
        flight for its duration. That does two things at once:

        1. **No commit conflict** — the Rewrite has the manifest to itself,
           so cleanup actually completes every beat.
        2. **Cross-process safe** — ``delete_unverified=False`` keeps lance
           from deleting any file it cannot tie to a removed version, i.e. a
           file a writer in *another process* (a CLI ``cascade sync`` /
           ``backfill``) may be mid-commit on. The per-table write lock is
           in-process only, so it cannot fence a second process; the flag is
           what makes concurrent processes safe. Reclaiming *during* active
           load comes from running under the write lock so the cleanup commit
           never loses the manifest race, not from the flag.

        ``cleanup_older_than`` deletes the *files* under a superseded
        ``_indices/<uuid>/`` but never the directory (lance's cleanup is
        written against an object store where an empty directory does not
        exist), so those husks accumulate on a local filesystem. They are
        swept here, outside the lock — see :func:`_remove_empty_index_dirs`
        for why that is safe.

        The trade-off is a brief write stall (~seconds on a churned table,
        dominated by the cleanup's file scan/delete — flat, not proportional
        to the backlog). Cascade runs it on a slow beat
        (``CascadeWorker`` prune cadence), so the stall is rare. Does *not*

    async def rebuild_indexes(self) -> None:
        """Rebuild every index on this table **in place**.

        **Why this exists** — workaround for an upstream Python API gap:

        Lance's Rust ``OptimizeOptions`` has a ``num_indices_to_merge``
        knob (default 1) that bounds the number of active index UUIDs
        per column. With ``Some(1)``, every ``optimize_indices()`` call
        merges its delta into the base — active UUID count stays at 1.

        Two problems block us from using it from the application layer:

        1. ``lancedb.AsyncTable.optimize()`` does **not expose** this
           parameter. It forwards only ``cleanup_older_than`` and
           ``delete_unverified`` to Rust.
        2. Even calling Lance directly via ``pylance``, the merge
           behaviour itself is buggy on ``lance crate 4.0`` (what
           lancedb 0.30.2 embeds) — ``num_indices_to_merge=1`` does
           nothing.

        So on the current stack there is **no application-level path**
        to bound active index UUID growth. ``optimize()`` keeps
        accumulating one new UUID (vector) / one new ``part_N`` (FTS)
        per call.

        This method is the workaround: rebuild every indexed column from
        the schema's ``ensure_fts_indexes`` contract. Measured effect —
        the live index file set collapses back to its steady state after
        many ``optimize()`` beats. The rebuild is an **O(N) full
        retrain** but cheap in practice (~0.3s for 50k rows × 2 FTS
        columns on local SSD).

        It rebuilds **in place** (``create_index(replace=True)`` — supported
        on lancedb 0.30.2's Python async API, verified by inspection of the
        installed package) rather than dropping first. An earlier version
        dropped every index and recreated them, on the assumption that
        LanceDB falls back to a brute-force scan meanwhile. That is true for
        vector search and **false for FTS**: with no inverted index a BM25
        query raises ``Cannot perform full text search unless an INVERTED
        index has been created`` (measured). Because the recall legs are
        gathered without ``return_exceptions``, one failing leg fails the
        whole search request, so the drop-first window was a source of 500s.
        Only indexes on columns that are no longer indexed at all get
        dropped; nothing queries those, so their drop opens no window.

        **Cadence** — :class:`CascadeWorker` runs this on a slow loop
        (default 12h per kind). Frequency is bounded by the rebuild
        cost, not by correctness — even daily is fine functionally;
        12h is a conservative pick to keep file/UUID counts well below
        any FD ceiling under steady-state ingest.

        **When to remove** — once lancedb exposes ``num_indices_to_merge``
        on the async Python API **and** the embedded ``lance crate``
        ships the working merge implementation, delete this method and
        switch to ``optimize(num_indices_to_merge=1)`` in the regular
        ``optimize()`` path. Tracking issues / context:
