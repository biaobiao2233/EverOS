"""Markdown file writer with atomic write semantics.

Atomicity is provided by writing to a same-directory temp file
(``.<name>.tmp.<uuid>``) and using :func:`os.replace` to rename it onto
the target. Keeping the temp file in the same directory guarantees the
rename is on the same filesystem (POSIX rename is atomic only within a
single fs).

All public methods are async. File I/O (``read_text`` / ``write_text``
/ ``mkdir``) goes through :class:`anyio.Path`; the few syscalls without
a native async equivalent (``os.fsync`` / ``os.replace`` / ``unlink``
in the cleanup path) are offloaded via :func:`anyio.to_thread.run_sync`.

In-process per-path locking
---------------------------
:meth:`append_entry` / :meth:`append_entries` are read-modify-write of
the whole file (load frontmatter+body, merge an entry block, atomic
write the result). The atomic write itself is safe, but the read→write
window crosses ``await`` points. Concurrent asyncio tasks targeting the
same path would otherwise lose-update each other (both read N entries,
both produce N+1, second write overwrites the first → 1 entry lost).

To prevent this, an in-process per-path :class:`asyncio.Lock` is held
across the entire read-modify-write sequence. Lock objects live on the
writer instance (not class-level) so they bind to the event loop active
when the writer was constructed — this avoids the
"Lock bound to different loop" failure mode that surfaces when
pytest-asyncio rebuilds the loop between tests but module-level writer
singletons leak Lock objects across boundaries.

Process-level coordination (multi-process writers against the same
memory-root) remains the job of
:func:`everos.core.persistence.locking.memory_root_lock`, which uses
``fcntl.flock``. The two locks compose: per-path async lock serialises
tasks within one process, ``memory_root_lock`` serialises processes
against each other.
