"""Hierarchical episode retrieval — two-path recall fused with per-fact eviction.

Episode HYBRID search path: combines episode-level hybrid recall (Layer 1)
with fact-driven MaxSim re-scoring (Layer 2), merges via RRF (Layer 3), then
runs a single-pass eviction where a fact that outscores its parent episode
enters top-N in place of the episode (Layer 4).

Uses everalgo operators as pure algorithm primitives; all I/O is injected
via recaller callbacks.  No changes to the everalgo library are required.
